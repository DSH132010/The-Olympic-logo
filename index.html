		The interlocking rings of the Olympic flag was created by Baron Pierre de Coubertin,<br> the co-founder of the modern Olympic games.  The five rings represented the five participating continents of the time: Africa, Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania.<br><br>  While the colors of the five rings, blue, yellow, black, green, and red together with the white background of the flag could compose the colors of every nation’s flag at the time of its inception as the official Olympic symbol in 1915.  This is what the inventor, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, had to say about his Olympic symbol in 1931.<br><br>“The Olympic flag has a white background, with five interlaced rings in the centre: blue, yellow, black, green and red. This design is symbolic; it represents the five continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six colours are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at the present time.”
